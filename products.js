// The products database is a collection of products each with fields of:
//
// name: String
// price: Number
// department: String
// color: String
// sales: Number
// stock: Number
// The sales are the number of times that particular product has been sold. The stock is the number of units in stock of that product.
//
// To get started import __products__.js into your MongoDB database with the following command:
//
// $ mongoimport --db test --collection products --file __products__.js
// Inserting Products

// Insert a product with the following properties

db.products.insert({
  name: "Hammer",
  price: 9.99,
  department: "Hardware",
  color: "red",
  sales: 80,
  stock: 50
});

// Insert the following products in a single query

var multiple = [
  {
    name: "Screwdriver",
    price: 19.99,
    department: "Hardware",
    color: "green",
    sales: 75,
    stock: 50
  },
  {
    name: "Wrench",
    price: 21.99,
    department: "Hardware",
    color: "orange",
    sales: 70,
    stock: 50
  }
];

db.products.insert(multiple);

// Updating Products
//
// Note for some of these you may have to refer to update operators like $min and $max.
//
// Change the department of all products in the "Hardware" department to "Hardware Tools"

db.products.update(
  { department: "Hardware" },
  { $rename: { department: "Hardware Tools" } },
  { multi: true }
);

// Change the price of all products in the "Hardware Tools" department to cost $10 more than their current price

db.products.update(
  { department: "Hardware Tools" },
  { $inc: { price: 10 } },
  { multi: true }
);

// Update the sales of all the products in the "Hardware Tools" department to be at least 50

db.products.update(
  { department: "Hardware Tools" },
  { $min: { price: 50 } },
  { multi: true }
);

// Change the department of all the products in the "Hardware Tools" department to be "Hardware" again

db.products.update(
  { department: "Hardware Tools" },
  { $rename: { department: "Hardware" } },
  { multi: true }
);

// Change the price of all the products in the "Hardware" department to be $10 less than their current price

db.products.update(
  { department: "Hardware" },
  { $inc: { price: -10 } },
  { multi: true }
);

// Change the sales of all the products in the "Hardware" department to be at most 10

db.products.update(
  { department: "Hardware" },
  { $max: { price: 10 } },
  { multi: true }
);

// Update the first product in the "Hardware" department to have one more sale

db.products.update(
  { department: "Hardware" },
  { $inc: { sales: 1 } },
  { justOne: true }
);

//Removing Products

//Remove the first product in the "Hardware" department
db.products.remove({ department: "Hardware" }, { justOne: true });

//Remove all products in the "Hardware" department
db.products.remove({ department: "Hardware" });

//
// Finding Products
//
// Note that you should use projection for these queries to filter the returned fields to only those fields described in each problem.

// Find the names of all the products that are out of stock

db.products.find({ stock: 0 }, { _id: 0, name: 1, stock: 1 });

// Find the stock count of all the products with a price below $100

db.products.find({ stock: { $lt: 100 } }, { _id: 0, name: 1, stock: 1 });

// Find the name, color and department of all the products with a price between $100 and $1000

db.products.find(
  { price: { $gte: 100, $lt: 1000 } },
  { _id: 0, name: 1, price: 1 }
);

// Find the names of all the red products
db.products.find({ color: "red" }, { _id: 0, name: 1 });

// Find only the IDs of all the red and blue products
db.products.find({{ color: "red" }, {color:'blue'} }, { _id: 0, name: 1 });

// Find the names of all the products that are not red or blue

// Find the names of all the products that are not in the Sports or Games departments

// Find the name and price of all the products with names that begin with the letter F and end with the letter S and ignore case

// Using $where, find all the product names that begin with T

// Using $where, find all the product names that begin with capital F or end with lowercase S
// Using $where, find all the product names that begin with capital T and have a price less than $100

// Using $where, find all the product names and prices of products that either start with A and have a price of at least $100 or start with B and have a price of at most $100

//
// With the Aggregation Pipeline
//
// For each of these challenges use the Aggregation Pipeline to create a query that returns the described results.
//
// Find the total number of sales each department made and sort the results by the department name
// Find the total number of sales each department made of a product with a price of at least $100 and sort the results by the department name
// Find the number of out of stock products in each department and sort the results by the department name
// With Map-Reduce
//
// For each of these challenges use the Map-Reduce to create a query that returns the described results.
//
// Find the number of products with each color
// Find the total revenue of each department (how much did each department make in sales?)
// Find the potential revenue of each product (how much can each product make if the entire remaining stock is sold?)
// Find the sum of the total and potential revenue for each product
// With Single Purpose Aggregation Operations
//
// For each of these challenges use the Single Purpose Aggregation Operations to create a query that returns the described results.
//
// How many products are there?
// How many products are out of stock?
// How many products are fully stocked? (100)
// How many products are almost out of stock? (>= 5)
// What are all the unique names of all the departments?
// What are all the unique names of product colors?
// Find the total number of out of stock products for each department.
// Now would be a great time to commit!
