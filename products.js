// The products database is a collection of products each with fields of:
//
// name: String
// price: Number
// department: String
// color: String
// sales: Number
// stock: Number
// The sales are the number of times that particular product has been sold. The stock is the number of units in stock of that product.
//
// To get started import __products__.js into your MongoDB database with the following command:
//
// $ mongoimport --db test --collection products --file __products__.js
